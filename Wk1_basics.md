**Getting help**
- help(function name) The help function is very handy if all you need is minor clarification on how a specific method works.
- type() is equivalent to class function in R
- to determine the methods available to you based on the object type
  - dir function with object name or type as input  
**Basics**
- Declaration
  - list : x = [2,44,6,8]
**Methods, functions, attributes, objects**
- Methods are functions associated with objects, whereas data attributes are data associated with objects. correct 
  - Function (a method) always ends with () e.g. x= np.array([1,2,3]); Function mean will be written as x.mean() 
Attribute doesn't end with () e.g. x.shape
- Types of objects
  - immutable objects : strings and tuples
  - mutable objects : dictionaries and lists
- Importing libraries/modules
  - import numpy as np <- saves typing
  - from math import pi <- no need to import the whole module, just the parts you need
  
  **Numbers & basic calculations**
  - Numbers
    - integers
    - floating point : number with decimal
    - complex numbers
  - basic calculations or operations
    - // <- integer division or floor division rounds down the answer to the closest integer e.g. 15//7 = 2
  - _ stores the value of the last operation : this is pretty handy if you want to do operations on the fly with the current answer
  - expressions and boolean
    - boolean types i.e. True or False, SHOULD be capitalized
    - boolean operations : and, or, not
